# Python Exercises

## Introduction
This repository contains practical Python exercises aimed at practicing the implementation of functions to calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle, and a program to manage monthly expenses and budget. These exercises help improve programming skills and understanding of basic Python concepts.



## Exercise 1: Calculating the Perimeter and Area of a Rectangle
**Description:**
This exercise involves writing functions to calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The program then tests the functions with sample inputs to ensure correctness.

**Usage:**
- Define functions to calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle.
- Test the functions with sample inputs.
 
 ## Exercise 2: Monthly Expense and Income Management

This project includes a Python script for managing monthly expenses and income. The program takes the type of purchase and its amount, storing this information in a dictionary. It can then calculate the total expenses and, finally, with the input of your budget, determine whether you have exceeded your budget or not.

### Description

This program helps you easily manage your monthly expenses and income. By using this program, you can simply enter the types of your purchases and calculate the total expenses. Finally, by entering your monthly budget, the program will inform you if you are within your budget or have exceeded it.
