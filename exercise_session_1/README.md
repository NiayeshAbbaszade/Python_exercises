# Python Exercises

## Introduction
This repository contains two simple Python exercises aimed at practicing the use of  try-except for error handling and implementing a number guessing game. These exercises help improve programming skills and understanding of basic Python concepts.

## Exercises

### 1. Checking User's Age for Voting Eligibility
**Description:**
This exercise checks if a user is eligible to vote based on their age. The program asks the user to input their age and uses a try-except block to handle any invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values). If the age is 18 or above, the user is eligible to vote; otherwise, they are not.

**Usage:**
- The user is prompted to enter their age.
- If the input is not a valid number, an error message is displayed.
- If the input is valid, the program checks if the user is eligible to vote.

### 2. Number Guessing Game
**Description:**
This program is a simple number guessing game. The user is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100. The program will provide feedback indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target number. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.

**Usage:**
- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- If the guessed number is higher than the target number, the program will indicate "Too high."
- If the guessed number is lower than the target number, the program will indicate "Too low."
- The program continues to prompt the user for guesses until the correct number is guessed.
- When the correct number is guessed, the program displays a congratulatory message and exits.
