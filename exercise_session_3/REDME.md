# Python Exercises

This repository contains solutions to various Python exercises. The exercises are as follows:

## Exercise 1: Fibonacci Sequence
Write a Python script that takes the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate from the user and prints the sequence correctly.

## Exercise 2: Pascal's Triangle

This project prints Pascal's Triangle in a triangular shape.

### Description
Pascal's  Triangle : Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. This program generates Pascal's Triangle and prints it in a triangular format.

## Exercise 3 : Square list elements using lambda and map

This project contains a list that receives from userList and returns a list of its squares using 'lambda' and 'map'.

### Description

This program helps you to easily calculate the square of all the elements in a given list. Using the "lambda" functions and the "map" function, it applies a square operation to each element in the list and returns a new list with squared values.

## Exercise 4: Sorting the list of tuples based on the second element using lambda

This project consists of a Python program that takes a list of tuples from the user and sorts the list by the second element of the tuples using "lambda".

### Description

This program helps you sort a list of tuples by the second element of each tuple. Using the "lambda" functions and the "sorted" function, it sorts the tuples and returns a new list sorted by the second element of each tuple.


## Exercise 5: Sum of two lists using lambda
 This project contains a Python program that takes two lists of equal length from the user and returns a list containing the sum of the elements of the two lists using "lambda".
 ### Description
 This program helps you to calculate the sum of two lists in terms of elements. Applies the sum operation to the corresponding elements in the two lists, using the lambda functions and the map function, and returns a new list with the summed values.
